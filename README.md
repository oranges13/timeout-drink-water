#TimeOut Drink Water Reminder

This is a small api and theme for <a href="https://www.dejal.com/timeout" target="_blank">TimeOut</a>, a MacOS application that reminds you to take breaks! The [theme](https://github.com/oranges13/timeout-drink-water/tree/master/theme/Unsplash%20Drink%20Water.totheme) shows a message reminding you to take a break and hydrate along with stock imagery from <a href="https://www.unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>.

The [API](https://github.com/oranges13/timeout-drink-water/tree/master/api) is a personal proof of concept in Lumen v8 and utilizes the service container so that the image provider can be configured between Unsplash or Pexels if necessary.

Feedback welcome!
